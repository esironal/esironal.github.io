DWZ rich client framework (jQuery RIA framework), is China's own development based on open source framework jQuery Ajax RIA implementation.

DWZ rich client framework design goal is <b> simple, practical, easy expansion, rapid development, RIA ideas, lightweight </b>

DWZ support the use of html scalable way to replace the javascript code, which can not guarantee programmers Dong javascript, also can use various page components and ajax technology. If you have specific requirements can also be extended DWZ do civilized custom.

Many programmers unfamiliar domestic javascript, greatly affected the development speed. Use automatic bonding DWZ framework javascript effect javascript does not require developers to care about how to write, writing can be a standard html. DWZ a simple extension of the standard html to HTML defines some special class and attribute. DWZ framework will find the current request results in those particular class and attribute, and automatically associate the corresponding js handle events and effects.

DWZ based on jQuery can very easily customize the specific needs of UI components, and published in the form of jQuery plug-ins.

We welcome suggestions, we will further adjust and improve the function in the next version.

DWZ rich client framework is completely open source, freely available full source code. The team everyone is open-source advocates, hope for the Chinese open source software business to do their part.
