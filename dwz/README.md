DWZ support the use of html scalable way to replace the javascript code, which can not guarantee programmers Dong javascript, also can use various page components and ajax technology. If you have specific requirements can also be extended DWZ do civilized custom.

Many programmers unfamiliar domestic javascript, greatly affected the development speed. Use automatic bonding DWZ framework javascript effect javascript does not require developers to care about how to write, writing can be a standard html. DWZ a simple extension of the standard html to HTML defines some special class and attribute. DWZ framework will find the current request results in those particular class and attribute, and automatically associate the corresponding js handle events and effects.
