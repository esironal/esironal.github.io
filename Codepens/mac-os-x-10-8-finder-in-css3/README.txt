A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/esironal/pen/wKEYrY.

 This is a WIP. I explain why later.

I recreated the 10.6 Finder almost 2 years ago. At that time a lot of people recreated a bunch of elements from the Mac UI in CSS3. Like the dock or various kinds of aqua buttons, etc. I decided to make the Finder to learn the kinks of CSS3 and just to see what I'm able to do with it.

That was almost 2 years ago. I've been learning SASS and HAML and all those "hip new things' and tried to update it with these, but I ended up breaking half the thing and the code just looks horrible. It's a code-monster. 2 days ago I finally decided to update my CSS3 project.

I had this whole idea where I would add another, smaller, window next to it telling you to click a button and then a number of red notification bubbles appear at the various places where I would add functionality. E.g. on the folders to select them or the share button to create a new div with CoffeeScript that let's you share this pen on Twitter (useful if I would embed this pen into my current Finder page).

But I had a different idea. I want to make this project into a CSS framework. A Cocoa framework in CSS. And that's what I'm currently working on. I don't know if people want this framework or not but It sounds like a fun project.

And that's why this is a WIP. I will rewrite most of the code, separate it into 3 or more files and release it on GitHub. I'll update this pen once I'm done.

Thank you Chris for creating CodePen. I think the fact that I could see the changes immediately and still use HAML and SASS was what pushed me to finally build this and come up with the idea.

Have a nice day, everyone. I'm off coding my little framework (and looking up on Apple suing people replicating their GUI in CSS...)
